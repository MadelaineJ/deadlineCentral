# Project files for Deadline Central

Note: This project will only run on the kit lab machines because it uses OpenSSL

## To run deadline central:
`make run`

*See instructions for using the application at the end*


## To clean all bin/ and build/ files:
`make clean`

## To Run deadline central unit tests:
`make test`
Note: this will freeze for 10-30 seconds. It is slow but will finish eventually

Note: The makefile to create the testing executable is not set up perfectly, so it is best practice to do a
`make clean`
before running `make test` to guarantee that you have the latest changes.

Note2: You should reset the database (instructions below), before running the tests. In an ideal world we would have two database accounts, one for
unit tests and one for running the application.


## Reset The Database Data
sqlplus team1/teamwon1@192.168.18.58:1539/XEPDB1
@../createTables_auto.sql

Or from the csci375/Project repo:
@createTables_auto.sql

The sqlplus command should NOT prompt you for a username or password. It should connect you directly to oracle. If it doesn't it means the database is down,
likely because someone restarted Kit4.
Because the VM only exists on Madelaine's Liux account (jonesme), please ping her to turn it back on. It should only take a few minutes.


### Testing accounts:
You can check the createTables_auto.sql for more user accounts. Use the email and password to login to deadline central.
You can also create your own account as an instructor or as a student.
