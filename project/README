project files for TeamWon
to run deadline central:
`make run`

to run deadline central unit tests: (note right now this runs a couple sqrt tests)
`make test`

to run demo db example application:
`make run-example


Right now there are some square root calculator files in the repo. This was so I could get the makefile working with
multiple test files. It can be removed once more tests have been added.
