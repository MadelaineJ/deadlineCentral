Using Deadline Central:

	This project is a task tracking application where students can login and view the upcoming tasks/assignments from their                                                      
	current courses as well as any personal tasks they create. Instructors can create courses and

Trouble-shooting:                                                                                                           
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                           
    If you end up in a menu you don't want to be selecting the "BACK" or "<> Menu" option will return you to prevous menu.
    There are many instances where you cannot return to previous menu until the current use case is completed.
    
    If you are ever stuck and using the command 'ctl C' dosen't work you have two options:
        1) Close the terminal window and relaunch the application.
        2) input the command 'ctl Z' then kill the process (by any means necessary.)
    
    To kill a process you need the process ID, this is found by inputing the command 'ps u -U yourusername'  
                                                                                                                            
    In the LOGIN MENU there is the option "HELP" that provides you with tips on how to navigate through menus, and how      
    to return to previous ones.

List of known issues:                                                                                                       
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                         
    - resizing the terminal window will result in input being read (even thought there is none)                      
    - filtering tasks by course is very slow (can take up to 1 minute)
    - if user ID is less that 1001 then the user is a student (thus only a limited number of student can be supported)
    - user cannot choose which values to edit, all values must be edited for tasks and courses

TODO:

    There is one major functionality that was not implemented, and several minor additions left to do.

    Major Use Cases:
    - Marking a personal task as complete
        - This would involve adding menu options to the task menu
    - Marking a course task as complete
        - This would involve reworking the database to add a new schema, and making a copy of each course task for all students
        that have subscribed to the course

    Minor Changes:
    - Allowing instructors to view enrollment list
    - Allowing instructors to see how many students are in their course
    - Allowing users to choose which values they want to edit when editing a course or task 
    - Improving the speed of filtering and sorting task list
    - Allowing users to view tasks and courses individually instead of in a list

    Code Quality:
    - Writing unit tests for all controller functions
    - Writing unit tests for commands.cpp
    - Writing end-to-end tests using a bash script to run the deadlineCentral executable, pass userinput and check the output
    - Breaking up commands.cpp into different files (most likely by object they impact)
    - Adding function comments to all functions explaining their purpose, author, return value and parameters
    - Adding comments to top of each .cpp file
    - Making all variable names consistent
    - Make sure controllers make use of other controllers where possible instead of DB class functions
    - Decided whether creating or updating object functions should take an object or a series of object attributes and be
        consistent. Currently Deadline Central uses both methods
    
    Extra:
    - There are some TODO comments/question in .cpp files throughout the project. These should be addressed and resolved
