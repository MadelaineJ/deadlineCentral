Using Deadline Central:

	This project is meant to be used as  a task tracking application where                                                  
	users can login and view the upcoming tasks/assignments from their                                                      
	current courses as well as any personal tasks they create.

Trouble-shooting:                                                                                                           
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                           
    If you end up in a menu you don't want to be selecting the "BACK" or "RETURN" option will return you to prevouis menus. 
    
    If you are ever stuck and using the command 'ctl C' dosen't work you have two options:
        1) Close the terminal window and relaunch the application.
        2) input the command 'ctl Z' then kill the process (by any means necessary.)
    
    To kill a process you need the process ID, this is found by inputing the command 'ps u -U yourusername'  
                                                                                                                            
    In the LOGIN MENU there is the option "HELP" that provides you with tips on how to navigate through menus, and how      
    to return to previous ones.

List of known issues:                                                                                                       
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                         
    - resizing the terminal window will result in input being read (even thought there is none)
    - students can delete/edit course tasks (they aren't suppose to be able to)
    - any user can delete a course if they know the course ID                         
    - filtering tasks by course is very slow (can take up to 1 minute)
    - if user ID is less that 1001 then the user is a student (thus only a limited number of student can be supported)
    - *ONCE* segmentation fault when filtering task by type
    - *ONCE* segmentation fault when subscribing to a course as a student (after doing task filtering/sorting)
    - lack of error checking
